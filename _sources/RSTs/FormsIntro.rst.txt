Call Sheet - The Forms
######################

Call Sheet uses names, phone numbers and roles entered into the NamesPhones sheet to populate the Call Sheet fields on the On-Call form. It was developed to facilitate publishing the Call Sheet form for the Operating Theatres and Post-Op Recovery to submit to the after-hours coordinator.

Call Sheet has two forms... the "On-Call" form, launched from the Call Sheet worksheet and the "Add or Edit Staff" form, launched from the "On-Call" form.


The On-Call Form
****************

The main form in Call Sheet is launched via the "Fill Out Call Sheet" button on the "Call Sheet" worksheet:

Whilst the fields on the sheet can be filled out manually, the provided "On-Call" form:

is designed to make the process much faster and less likely to create errors. The "On-Call" form has three basic areas:
 
   * :ref:`cf-datetgl`
   
   * :ref:`cf-staffname`
   
   * :ref:`cf-btmbuttons`
   


The Add or Edit Staff Form
**************************

The "Add or Edit Staff" form:

is launched by the green "Add/Edit Staff" button on the "On-Call" form. This form has three basic areas:

   * :ref:`es-stfname`
   
   * :ref:`es-stfdetails`
   
   * :ref:`es-btmbuttons`
