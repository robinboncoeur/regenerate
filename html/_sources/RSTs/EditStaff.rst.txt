Add or Edit Staff Information
#############################

The "Add or Edit Staff" form is launched from the "On-Call" form. 


.. _es-stfname:

Find Name in List
*****************

The dropdown at the top of the form ("AllStaff") allows the user to find a staff member's name and details for editing. The Name-order is whatever was selected in the "On-Call" form. The phone number(s) is/are next to the name. There is a number at the end of the field, but it normally won't be visible and is only useful to the software itself.

A name can be found by typing the name, or by clicking on the down-arrow of the dropdown to display the names in the dropdown list. Select a name by clicking on it, and the details of that individual will display in the fields below the dropdown, including the role(s) that person has in the department.

This dropdown list of staff does not include inactive staff names by default. In order to include those in the list, select the "Show All" ("ShowAll") tickbox. The list in the dropdown will be refreshed to include the inactive staff names.


.. _es-stfdetails:

Staffer Details
***************

**Required** staff detail information includes:

   * First Name ("FirstName")
   * Last Name ("LastName")
   * Primary phone number ("MainPhone") [#phone01]_
   * Role
   * Active status - defaults to "Active" 
   
 The secondary phone number ("SecndPhone") is not required: however, it is helpful to have in case the individual cannot be reached via the primary number.

.. _es-stfrole:

Staffer Role
************

In the On-Call form, staff members appear in a given dropdown based on roles performed. That role selection is done here:

   * Scrub/Scout ("ScrubScout")
   * Anaes "thetics" ("Anaes")
   * PACU "Post-op recovery" ("PACU")
   * OTA "Operating theatres assistant" ("OTA")

   Note: *Bear in mind that a staff member can perform more than one role in the Operating Theatres and Post-op Recovery.*

Below the role tickboxes is the "Active" ("DeActive") tickbox. Unticking this box will keep the staff member's record on NamesPhones but will render it invisible to the StaffNames dropdowns. [#activ02]_


.. _es-btmbuttons:

Action Buttons
**************

There are buttons at the bottom of the form consist of five buttons:

   * The "New" button ("NewStaff") writes the selections to the Call Sheet.
   * The "Save" button ("SaveStaff") saves the entry to the "NamesPhones" sheet.
   * The "Cancel" button ("CancelStaff") cancels the Edit and closes the form without saving.
   * The "Delete" button ("DeleteStaff") deletes the displayed staff member's record from the "NamesPhones" sheet.
   * The "Help" button ("ESHelp") brings up this document, opened on the EditStaff page.
   * The "Close" button ("ESClose") closes the "Edit Staff" form.


Footnotes

 .. rubric:: Notes
   
 .. [#phone01] The individual may elect to have the landline phone as primary phone, or the mobile. Be sure to ask. Also, this may change: as you can see the [Swap] ("Swap") button makes assigning opposite roles to the phone numbers a trivial task. 
 
 .. [#activ02] It is suggested to leave the staff member's record in the "NamesPhones" sheet as employment status can revert to what it was before he or she left. These things happen, so it's nice to already have that data there.
